# Restaurante-Intelligente
RI is made solely for the purpose to preserve the most valuable and precious commodity “TIME” of people as well as the restaurant staff. It covers all aspects of restaurant staff and members need to make their place tidy and organized. “Restaurante Intelligente” covers aspects like, Taking feedback from facial recognition is itself a very different project but we thought that if we could include this in our project it would be very efficient for the staff as taking feedbacks from the customer is very time consuming and people find it a very boring job. It allows people to book their seat and order their food through the customer app and also gives the restaurant staff to manage their customer’s list as well know the order of the food they have given by our restaurant’s app. Though it took us a lot of time to think about this project while working on it our only motivation was the thought of saving one’s time which is very important in this era of modernization. The main problem people face while going to the restaurant is the perfect location for seating and our customer’s app has also taken care of this thing by giving the 360-degree view of the restaurant and choosing their seating accordingly. In these pandemic times, our app also enables the customer to check the hygiene and the recipe used to prepare their order which is the future addition in our app.
